### Introduction
This repository contains the code for a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) project, which is developed using Python with the Django framework. The LIMS is designed to manage the workflow of a laboratory, including sample tracking, data analysis, and reporting. 
As part of this project, the Sample Tracking module was developed. LIMS allows users to track sampling progress throughout a laboratory workflow, produce reagents, and create new reagent records
